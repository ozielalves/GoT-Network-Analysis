# Network Analysis - Game of Thrones
In this repository we are going to analyse data about characters interactions in Game of Thrones(GoT), more especifically at season 6. Through this, we are able to make several observations over their importances at the events occured in the show. The dataset we use here is created by Andrew J. Beveridge and Jie Shan. The dataset is publicly available [here](https://github.com/mathbeveridge/gameofthrones). At their repository there are also some rules on how these interactions are accounted for. Although it is not a perfect method, it can clearly show some of the important relationships between characters.
